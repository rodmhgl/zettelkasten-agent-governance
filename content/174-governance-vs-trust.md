## The Core Distinction

Entra Agent ID doesn't make AI agents trustworthy. It makes them governable. These are fundamentally different properties.

**Trustworthy**: Agent will do the right thing  
**Governable**: You can control what happens when it doesn't

## Why Governability Matters More

Trust cannot be verified at scale. You cannot:

- Review every agent decision
- Predict every edge case
- Guarantee intent translates to outcome

But you can:

- Define boundaries before deployment
- Monitor behavior against expectations
- Respond quickly when something goes wrong
- Audit after the fact

## The Strategic Shift

Microsoft's message: pretending agents are just background apps wasn't going to scale.

AI agents aren't experiments anymore—they're becoming operational dependencies. The question isn't whether you trust them. It's whether you can control them when you don't.

## Enterprise Readiness

This aligns with Microsoft's broader push to make Copilot and agent workflows auditable for:

- Compliance requirements
- Audit trails
- Incident response
- Risk management
